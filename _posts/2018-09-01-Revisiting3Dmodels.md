Improving surface normal vectors from Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) has been the primary focus of my PhD. 
However, I have intermittently spent some time developing 3D models from RTI surface normal data.
I have also developed a Virtual Reality (VR) environment to view these 3D models (see below).

I aim to develop 3D models generated from RTI and post the results [here][models-link].
