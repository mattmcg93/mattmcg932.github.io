I'm currently working on three side projects (which are all in various stages of completion) during the lockdown: 

1) Controlling my telescope motors using Python a webcam to track objects photographically (different from conventional tracking methods).

2) Creating an autonomous Raspberry Pi Wi-Fi remote control car which will (hopefully) drive itself.

3) Running TensorFlow object recognition on my Raspberry Pi 1st edition (so basically a slow antique) with a PlayStation 2 EyeToy.



This page is a work in progress so the camera link below (running from a PlayStation 2 EyeToy and Raspberry Pi 1st edition) may be intermittent. Code and more details coming soon...
