Following the resounding success of our 2018 conference, myself and the rest of the committee are organising another ambitious event. In my role as Outreach officer for Space Exe at the University of Exeter, we have reached out to speakers from the Met Office, various universities and various observatories. Our student led conference hopes to be as successful as last year, with engaging talks and a great turnout of students and interested members of the community, with some people even travelling down from Bristol.

Video talks from last year's conference and information about what we do as a society and the speakers can be found [here][conf-link].


This year the conference is 17th March 2019 9:30 - 17:30.
