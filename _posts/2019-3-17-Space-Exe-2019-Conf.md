The [Smart Industry Workshop][SmartWorkshop-link] was great for networking as it was aimed at bringing researchers and industry experts together who use automation and robotics in their work. The workshop also included a hands on tutorial on using the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) using the Sundance VCS-1. The workshop was thoroughly enjoyable and I met some very interesting people who's work I will follow and keep in touch with.

A poster I also presented can be found on page 14 of their poster section [here.][poster-link]
