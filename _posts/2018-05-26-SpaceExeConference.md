I am the Outreach officer for Space Exe at the University of Exeter, who organised a spectacular conference with speakers from Met Office, Goonhilly Earth Station, University of Exeter and the UK ambassador for NASAâ€™s OSIRIS REx.
Our student led conference was a resounding success, with engaging talks and a great turnout of students and interested members of the community, with some people even travelling down from Bristol.

Video talks from the conference and information about what we do as a society and the speakers can be found [here][conf-link].
